As a child, Franco would often overhear his father having strange conversations in foreign languages with burly looking men clearly not from the government. Domestic abuse was a regular thing in the Franco household and the children quickly learned to stay away from the house when Jorge Senior was in one of his moods.<br><br>When Pinochet took over in 1973, violence came with him. Jorge Franco Senior vanished without a trace one evening in 1976 and two weeks later, young Jorge and his siblings were crossing the border into Argentina. From there, they travelled to the United States. While Franco was never quite sure how his mother managed to get them into the US, he later assumed that his mother simply provided the American government with all the information she had overheard his father sharing with the Russians that frequented their home.<br><br>Franco eventually graduated from college in the early 1980’s, holding a degree in natural science with a chemistry focus. He got a job working for a local high school, where he taught chemistry and physics for many years while at the same time building up a rather unhealthy gambling addiction. After Pinochet was removed from power, Franco decided to go back to Chile to discover his roots. His mother had passed a few years earlier and Franco never really found the US to be a suitable home. Besides, he owed a substantial amount of money to a local gangster due to his habit of betting on the wrong horse. So, Franco simply ran away, leaving a wife and young child to fend for themselves.<br><br>While Franco didn’t discover what happened to his father, he did manage to find some rather unsavoury people. One of those people was Fernando Delgado, a winemaker of small repute and a known drug manufacturer who would often lend money to people in exchange for favors. Upon learning that Franco was a gifted chemist, Delgado told him he’d waive any debts in exchange for his services as a chemist. Franco agreed and found that his new vocation suited his needs very well indeed. He stayed with the Delgados until 2004 when everything was torn down around him. Don Fernando and his son were killed in freak accidents and the empire crumbled around him. Franco, fearing for his life and suffering from severe PTSD, went into hiding but was brought back a few years later when Fernando Delgado’s young nephew Rico, found him and brought him to Colombia.

Young Wazir eventually grew to the top of the gang and, after the old boss died in a car accident, he assumed the role of leader. At the ripe age of 12, his legend was already taking shape.<br><br>As the years passed, Wazir Kale grew with the task, taking care of the children who relied so much on him. In time, the legends outgrew the boy who by then had become a young man. Then, on a hot summer night, the Mumbai mafia decided to set an example and exert the ‘protection’ it was paid to provide shopkeepers with. The Crows were rounded up and Wazir got a severe beating. All but a few remaining Crows were not so lucky. Some legends have it he fought bravely as the gangsters burned down the shack filled with children and young men. Others mention it was in fact Kale himself who killed the Crows.<br><br>Whatever the truth is, Wazir Kale was subsequently initiated into the mafia and accepted his new position with an eye for revenge. A few years later, as he moved up the ranks, he was finally able to exert his revenge. He did so with incredible fury, practically annihilating the local mob outfit. This event added fuel to his already legendary reputation and “The Maelstrom” was born.<br><br>Post-carnage, Kale got out of Mumbai and ended up roaming around the Asian continent. Along the way, he picked up a rag-tag bunch of criminals with whom he formed a sort of paramilitary unit. Together, they eventually ended up raiding commercial ships in the South China Sea, stealing the transported fuel in highly coordinated hits and selling it on the black market.<br><br>The pressure on Kale kept building as the constant obligations mounted. Each new raid forced him to find new waters, find new partners, relocate to another abandoned island. On top of that, the legend forged by the pirates who retired from the raiding added more pressure than ever and gripped his crew in such a way that they began acting more carelessly, adopting more loose tactics and to some extent, chose more daring targets. They were, after all, with The Maelstrom.<br><br>One night, while raiding a Hamsun Oil freighter, a firefight ensued between the Maelstrom’s crew and the ship’s unexpectedly well-armed security force. Someone had tipped them off about the raid and the owner of Hamsun Oil had insisted that the pirates be dealt with – with extreme prejudice. While Kale survived, most of his crew did not and from the wreckage emerged a darker, more menacing figure. Wazir Kale was gone and all that remained was The Maelstrom. This was a dark time for Kale who had not only lost his way but also control of his outfit – all that remained was a desire to destroy, to tear down the bastions of rich westerners who had brought so much injustice to every single member of his crew.<br><br>And then, a light was lit in the far distance. One of The Maelstrom’s surviving crew members contacted him and let him know that a man of great importance wanted to see him. The Maelstrom agreed to the meeting and over the course of a few days got to know Lucas Grey and understand his agenda. While not an altruistic person, The Maelstrom saw something in what Grey was selling – a chance to find a new purpose, to solidify the legend of The Maelstrom into something beyond a modern-day pirate. He would bring liberation to the entire world, no matter the cost in blood.",

She quickly learned that to succeed, she would need to transform herself entirely from the classic businesswoman she’d been bred to become.

She’s an expert at finding loopholes, exploiting tax rules and laundering money for criminals and has been involved in numerous tax evasion schemes, which have earned her multiple “Banker of the Year” awards in the last decade.\r\n<br> \r\nOver the years, Savalas has also developed a refined disdain for the middle class, reducing customers to numbers on sheets of paper with no thought to the things she destroys with her constant “less is more” approach to small and medium-sized businesses.

The director was depicted as a blackmailer and conspirator, who aimed to entrap Dame Barbara in a scheme to pay off the mounting costs of Vicar's own private vices. Shortly thereafter, the director was involved in a conspicuously timed car accident, officially (and publicly) considered a suicide.<br>Now a somewhat more paranoid (and significantly more cautious) Dame Barbara is preparing for her political comeback, with help from an uncanny body double."

				"1490854150": "Born in the early 1980s, Alexios Laskaridis' childhood was heavily influenced by the electronic music scene maturing alongside him. He spent his youth on the move with his family -- both of his parents being touring theater actors -- but he was always able to turn to the world of music to keep him anchored. It was a lifestyle that lead him easily into his own role on stage. In Laskaridis' case, it was the DJ booth specifically that called to him. This career kept him flexible. He was comfortable moving on with the seasons, going where the crowds (and the work) were, and never laying roots down too deeply. It worked for the most part,  but in those gaps and hollows when it didn’t quite come together there was always a little bit of illicit work to be found nearby. Drug trafficking helped Laskaridis make ends meet, but he swore he would give it up once he'd built more of a following, or once he’d bought a club of his own. <br><br>It was a jealous up-and-comer from a privileged family who threw a wrench in these admittedly naive plans. Money was exchanged, and not long after, Laskaridis' hand was crushed under a poorly-secured piece of stage decor. Although he would eventually make a full recovery, it came with a significant amount of downtime in his budding career. Nevertheless the bills had to be paid. While his skills as a performer risked atrophy, his connections and criminal talents were honed. When he made his inevitable comeback, many agreed that he wasn't quite the same. His hand seemed perfectly fine, but the experience had hardened him. He was laser-focused now – but on what is anyone's guess. Clarity only came when the man who had arranged his accident (an open secret in their tight social circle) disappeared, leaving behind only a single foot in a brand new sneaker on the side of the highway. <br><br>Laskaridis' face became a less common sight on stage after that. The underworld had given him power where his music had failed to. His alliance shifted accordingly, and he made it his mission to dominate the scene in a manner where he knew he could seize the upper hand."
