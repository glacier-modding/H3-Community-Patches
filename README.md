# Community Patches

A collection of Quality of Life fixes for Hitman III (or Hitman: World of Assassination). This ranges from localisation line break fixes, all the way to model part replacements to fix inverted normals on clothing, and everything in-between. If it's broken in-game, this project aims to fix it!

## Contributing

To contribute a fix, make a branch (or make a fork if you don't have permissions to make a branch), and then commit your fix to the branch as `feat: fix this thing`. Note: do not use a `fix:` commit - your fix is to the game, not to the mod (it's a _feature_ of the mod, hence the `feat:` tag; a `fix:` commit would be if one of the mod's bug fixes didn't work properly and you were resolving that). Then, make a pull request to this repository. If there's an issue in this repository that your contribution fixes, you can add `Fixes #15` (or whatever the number is) to the PR description and the issue will be closed automatically when your PR is merged.
